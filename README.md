# Data Structures Problems Solution
This is the Data Structures domain project which provides solutions to some of the problems like finding shortest path through maze, magic print etc. All the problems are properly mentioned in DSAssigment1.docx file. Some are define here as well.

**Problem # 1 Magic Print (With Constraints)**

Write a program which for any given positive n, print integers from 1 to n and then print from n-1 to 1 using only a single loop without any explicit if-else statement and not using any other memory location except loop variable.

Input / Output
Enter a Positive Integer less than 10: 7
Magic Print for n=7: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 6 5 4 3 2 1


**Problem #2 Block of Numbers**

You are given a two-dimensional array of 10 X 10 consists of natural numbers in between (1-9), you are required to find the largest possible block (a sub array) within it that contains natural numbers between (a-b) a sub sequence of natural numbers in between (1-9). For example:
Array 10 X 10 with (1-9)

1 2 4 2 5 6 7 2 2 1
1 2 4 2 5 6 7 2 2 1
1 2 4 2 5 6 7 2 2 1
1 2 4 2 5 6 7 2 2 1
1 2 4 2 5 6 7 2 2 1
1 2 4 2 5 6 7 2 2 1
1 2 4 2 5 6 7 2 2 1
1 2 4 2 5 6 7 2 2 1
1 2 4 2 5 6 7 2 2 1
1 2 4 2 5 6 7 2 2 1
Output for (1-4)
Array 10 X 10 with (1-9)
1 2 4 2
1 2 4 2
1 2 4 2
1 2 4 2
1 2 4 2
1 2 4 2
1 2 4 2
1 2 4 2
1 2 4 2
1 2 4 2
Output for (2-7)
Array 10 X 10 with (1-9)
2 4 2 5 6 7 2 2
2 4 2 5 6 7 2 2
2 4 2 5 6 7 2 2
2 4 2 5 6 7 2 2
2 4 2 5 6 7 2 2
2 4 2 5 6 7 2 2
2 4 2 5 6 7 2 2
2 4 2 5 6 7 2 2
2 4 2 5 6 7 2 2
2 4 2 5 6 7 2 2
You are only required to print the dimension of the largest possible two-dimensional sub array
of sub-sequence. For the above example 4X10 and 8X10 will be the output.

**Problem # 4 Shortest path through a maze**

See DSAssigment1.docx file for the description of this problem.


**Problem # 6 Counting In-between**

Given two positive integers a and b, we usually write the numbers between a and b, inclusive, in a list. Your task is to write a program that counts the number of occurrences of each digit using single loop. For example, if a = 1024 and b = 1032, the list will be 1024 1025 1026 1027 1028 1029 1030 1031 1032
There are ten 0s in the list, ten 1s, seven 2s, three 3s, and etc.
Sort your output with respect to number of occurrences using shell sort and any other stable sort. 

Input / Output
Enter 2-Positive integers (a b): 1024 1032
There are: 0-10, 1-10, 2-7, 3-3, 4-1, 5-1, 6-1, 7-1, 8-1 and 9-1.
